<h3>Familiarity with the Internet and Email</h3>
<p>The student is responsible for understanding how to use an Internet browser (i.e., Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and sending and receiving Canvas Messages for this class. All assignments will be distributed and submitted via Canvas (accessible through the MCC portal <a href="https://my.mcckc.edu/">https://my.mcckc.edu</a>. The direct URL to the Canvas website.</p>
<p>If the student chooses to submit homework from a computer not located in the classroom computer lab or the campus open computer lab, the instructor is not responsible for network and computer issues from the student's computer or Internet Service Provider (ISP). Canvas is accessible from any computer with Internet access, so if you choose to use a computer not located on one of the Metropolitan Community College campuses, be sure to have an alternative in case of problems. The open computer labs at any Metropolitan Community College campus are an option for the student. If a problem should arise with the server where this course is hosted, modifications to the assignment's schedule will be necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>Any questions or concerns that arise outside of class should be sent to the instructor via Canvas Messages, the self-contained message system in Canvas. The instructor will attempt to reply to all messages received Monday through Friday within 24 hours from when it is received. Any correspondence sent to the instructor during the weekend may not be replied to until Monday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Campus Printing Limitations</h3>
<p>MCC tracks the number of pages each student prints at MCC computer classrooms, computer labs, and campus libraries. Students are allowed 200 black and white, single-sided pages at no cost. Once the 200-page allocation has been used, you may purchase additional pages for .10 per page using a credit card at your computer, through the library (cash only), or other authorized "Code Card" sellers. Additional copies purchased in a semester that are not used will be rolled over to the next semester. Any remaining free prints will not be rolled over if students do not use their 200 photographs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Inclement Weather</h3>
<p>Local television and radio stations will be notified when it becomes necessary to close the college due to inclement weather. If you hear a specific campus is closed, i.e., MCC &ndash; Blue River or MCC &ndash; Penn Valley, that does not necessarily include MCC &ndash; Maple Woods. Campus closings are also posted on the MCC website. MCC Notify Me is an emergency text message system that will send subscribers a message to their mobile devices in a public safety or weather-related emergency. Students and employees can sign up by logging in to MYMCCKC and clicking on the "Manage MCC Notify Me" link at the bottom of the left-hand menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Vacation/Extended Absence</h3>
<p>No modifications or exceptions will be made to the assignments schedule due to a student's absence for vacation or other extended absence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Helpful Tips</h3>
<p>Students have the right and responsibility to self-disclose a disability. <u>Please do not approach a student with a visible disability&mdash;a student who is having difficulty in class and ask if accommodations are needed</u>. The laws referenced above require the accommodation of only documented disabilities. If you have a student in your class who requires accommodations, the student will provide you with a Letter of Accommodation (LOA) from the DSS office. If a student tells you that they have a disability and has not received a Letter of Accommodation, please refer the student to the DSS office and contact me with the student's name to follow up with them.</p>

<p><strong>Academic Honesty:</strong> All forms of academic dishonesty, including:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Plagiarism &ndash; the intentional use of the ideas or words as one's own in a paper or other academic assignment.</li>
    <li>Cheating during examinations, whether by copying from a fellow student or using the information in the form of unauthorized aids brought to the examination.</li>

    <li>Using a false name or signing the name of another individual without proper authorization in connection with any course work.</li>
</ol>
<p>If objective evidence exists indicating that a student has practiced academic dishonesty, the following may occur:</p>
<ol>
    <li>If objective evidence for academic dishonesty exists, the instructor may require the paper, assignment, or examination to be repeated; lower the grade for this work; assign a grade of F to this work or assign a grade of F for the course.</li>
    <li>The instructor will notify the student of a meeting to discuss the alleged academic dishonesty and the proposed penalty, and that failure to respond to this notification will make the instructor's decision final.</li>
    <li>If a grade of F is assigned for the course, the instructor will notify the dean responsible for instructional services and the division chair in writing within two (2) business days after the student's meeting.</li>
    <li>If the instructor believes the alleged academic dishonesty supports disciplinary options other than a grade of F, the instructor will report the incident to the dean responsible for instructional services within five (5) business days after meeting the student. The dean of instruction will ensure that the dean of students is notified of the instructor's concerns. More information can find through this link: Student Code of Conduct</li>

<p><strong>Attendance Policy:</strong> Students are responsible for attending classes as required by their instructors and officially withdrawing from classes. MCC regulations state that an instructor may remove a student from class after a consecutive absence equating to 15% of the total class time or after total absences equating to 33% of the total class time. An instructor may choose to enforce a stricter attendance policy. If so, the instructor will notify you of this policy at the beginning of the semester. An instructor may grant an exception to this policy after holding a conference with a student.</p>

<p><strong>Disability Support Services (DSS):</strong> Metropolitan Community College (MCC) is committed to ensuring equal access to all qualified students with disabilities following the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). If you have a disability that may impact your ability to access or participate in any aspect of my class, please contact the campus Disability Support Services (DSS) Coordinator at your campus. The DSS Coordinator will work with you to determine what disability documentation/information is needed to provide accommodations. Accommodations are determined individually and may take some time to implement, so early notification to DSS is helpful. More information is available at <a href="http://www.mcckc.edu/disability.">http://www.mcckc.edu/disability.</a></p>
<p><strong>Final Exam:</strong> Final exams are given in all MCC classes, and students must take them. Final exams should be given at the posted time for the exam. Students are responsible for contacting their instructor if they miss the final exam. A student who has done satisfactory course work but misses the final exam may be allowed to make it up if the instructor believes the reason for missing the exam was reasonable. However, if a student misses the exam and has no reasonable explanation, the instructor may give the student an "F." Two hours are allowed for each final exam. Exams for classes with laboratories are scheduled by lecture hours. Students who have a conflict in exam times or have three or more final exams scheduled on the same day may arrange to reschedule one of them with the instructor's permission.

<p><strong>Grade Appeal Policy:</strong> A grade change request may be made, in writing, for a final grade, not including withdrawals or incompletes, to the instructor up to 120 working days following the grade's posting.</p>
<p><strong>Grievance Procedures for Students:</strong> If you have any questions or concerns about any aspect of this course, please see your instructor first to work together to resolve any problems that may exist. If we cannot resolve the problem in the unlikely event, the next step is to make an appointment with the Division Chair.

<p><strong>No-discrimination and Sexual Harassment:</strong> MCC, in keeping with the requirements of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, does not discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, ancestry, national origin, or disability. The district actively follows a non-discrimination policy in the areas mentioned above regarding all students' employment and retention.</p>
<p><strong>Federal and state laws, as well as MCC's Board of Trustee policy</strong>, prohibit sexual harassment. If you feel you, as a student, have been subjected to sexual harassment or any of the forms mentioned above of discrimination, contact the Dean of Student Development at your campus for further information.

<p><strong>Satisfactory Academic Progress:</strong> To retain eligibility for financial aid, recipients must make satisfactory academic progress toward their educational program each semester. Academic exemption, amnesty, or forgiveness is not allowed. The following will be reviewed at the end of each semester.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Recipients must earn and maintain a 2.0 cumulative grade point average. Grade point averages will be calculated according to college policy.</li>
    <li>Recipients must also maintain a cumulative successful (with an A, B, C, D grade) completion rate of a minimum of sixty-seven percent (67.00%) of courses attempted.</li>
    <li>Recipients must complete their academic program within no more than one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the number of credit hours required to finish their program without repeating any course. (Ex. 64 credits for A.A., can only take a total of 96 credit hours towards that degree)
        <ul>
            <li>Recipients' entire academic history will be evaluated when determining the credit hours that apply toward the maximum timeframe eligible for financial aid.</li>
            <li>Courses attempted and completed toward the student's current program are included when determining the maximum timeframe. Students can change their academic program and reset their full timeframe once approved.</li>
            <li>The maximum timeframe for financial aid will be adjusted for approved academic program changes and remedial/developmental coursework.</li>
            <li>Rejected transfer hours are excluded from this calculation.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Students who fail to meet the above are subject to losing financial aid eligibility. If you feel you are in danger of not meeting these standards or are considering withdrawing from a class, please seek academic assistance and meet with an advisor as soon as possible. Details about this policy can be found at <a href="https://www.mcckc.edu/sap">https://www.mcckc.edu/sap</a></p>
<p><strong>Retaking a Course:</strong> The best way to improve your GPA is to retake a class for which you received a "D" or an "F." The grade remains on your transcript, but the last one you earn is counted in your GPA. You may also retake a class transferred from another institution if the course is evaluated as an exact match. Other colleges may have different policies. There may be limits on the number of times you may repeat the same class.</p>
<p><strong>Withdrawal:</strong> <strong><u>The last day to withdraw is November 13, 2022</u></strong><u>. </u>Students are responsible for officially withdrawing from classes they do not plan to complete. A student who stops attending a class but remains on the class roster may receive an "F" in the class. If the student receives federal or state financial aid, they may be required to repay those benefits. Given this financial impact that can be a barrier to a student's success, faculty are also encouraged to drop students who have stopped attending, but it is not required. Students may drop a class through their myMCCKC student center or by visiting with an advisor. Dropping a class after the 100% refund period will result in a grade of "W" on the transcript. During the last 40% of a class, students will receive a grade for their academic progress. Students who stop attending class during this period could fall below satisfactory academic standards and receive a failing grade.</p>
<p>Instructors are not required to withdraw students or change an " F " grade if the student fails to assume this responsibility. Withdrawal forms are available through an academic advisor or from the Enrollment Center.</p>
